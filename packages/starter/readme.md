  A web app built with <a href="http://mercenary.io/">Mercenary</a>
</p>

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Additional Tasks

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Start the unit test watcher:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Build the client-side code:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm run prod
```

Start the production server in "non-production" mode, bypassing some functionality that would make visiting the app locally while running in production mode impossible:

```bash
npm run prod:local
```

Deploy the Dockerized application to ElasticBeanstalk:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Perform a local build of the production Docker image:

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

Build and run the production Docker image locally:

```bash
npm run docker:run
```

Clean up build artifacts and reinstall dependencies:

```bash
npm run clean
```
