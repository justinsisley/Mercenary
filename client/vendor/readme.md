# The Vendor Directory

The `/client/vendor` directory is where your client side dependencies are stored. These dependencies are either installed via Bower, or are manually imported into the `/client/vendor/_nonBower` directory. This is covered in more detail in [Managing Dependencies](https://github.com/justinsisley/Mercenary/wiki/Managing-Dependencies).
