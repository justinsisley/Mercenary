# The CSS Directory

`/client/css` contains the main compiled CSS stylesheet (`style.css`) and icon font files. You'll never need to edit `style.css`, since it's automatically built from your LESS files. The built `style.css` file is ignored using .gitignore to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

Icon fonts are managed with [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). It's extremely easy to use, provides you with a large library of icons, and allows you to add your own custom-designed icons. To update your icon font, make a new set in Fontello (or import your current set and make changes from the Fontello web application), download the new icon font, unzip the archive, rename the directory to `fontello`, then move it into the `/css` directory. Note that you can use any name for the font directory, but that name must be referenced in the stylesheet include inside of `/server/dust/app.dust`. By default, it is referencing `/css/fontello/css/fontello.css`.
