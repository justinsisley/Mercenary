# The Dust Directory

The `/client/dust` directory contains the `.dust` files that will be compiled into client-side JavaScript templates. Compilation is performed exclusively during the development process using a custom Grunt task. Templates are compiled into their corresponding `/client/js/modules/.../templates` directory, with the `...` being replaced by the name of the owning module.

For example, if you create a module inside of `/client/js/modules` called `sidebar`, and your module requires a template, you would create a directory called `sidebar` within the `/client/dust` directory, then create your `sidebar.dust` file within that directory. With Grunt's "watch" task running, saving your new `.dust` file will automatically create the `/client/js/modules/sidebar/templates` directory, and your compiled JavaScript template file will be placed there. This whole process may seem counterintuitive to some, but it allows us to keep a clear separation between JavaScript and Dust files, while maintaining a common directory structure for our modules. Once your templates are compiled, you will simply `require` the compiled template in any JavaScript file that needs it. This allows everyone involved (Dust and requirejs) to perform exactly the function they are meant to serve, and nothing more.
